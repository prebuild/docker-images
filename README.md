# docker-images

**Docker images for cross compiling prebuilt binaries for Node.js. Used by [`prebuildify-cross`](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify-cross).**

## About

All images include Node.js LTS, Python 3.x, npm and a preconfigured build toolchain suitable for `node-gyp` and `prebuildify`. For example:

```
> docker run --rm ghcr.io/prebuild/alpine node -v
v16.15.1
```

Images are tagged with a major, minor and full version as well as `latest`. For example, use the following to pin to major version 2:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/prebuild/alpine:2
```

## Versioning guarantees

Within a major version range, we will not change toolchains, environment variables, working directories, users and more. However, the Node.js version will change without notice. We use Node.js [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) (at the time of building images) for a light maintenance effort. This is okay because `prebuildify` can target (the headers of) older Node.js versions while itself running on a newer version.

Images that are based on [`dockcross`](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross) (see below) may inadvertently introduce breaking changes because `dockcross` does not use semantic versions ([dockcross/dockcross#399](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross/issues/399)) and does not maintain a changelog that would allow us to easily categorize changes and then tag our images accordingly. If this concerns you we recommend pinning to an exact version (`x.x.x`) which we treat as immutable.

## Images

### [`centos7-devtoolset7`](https://github.com/orgs/prebuild/packages/container/package/centos7-devtoolset7)

Compile in CentOS 7, as a better alternative to (commonly) Ubuntu 16.04 on Travis or GitHub Actions. Makes prebuilds compatible with Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.04, RHEL 7, CentOS 7 and other Linux flavors with an old glibc.

> The neat thing about this is that you get to compile with gcc 7 but glibc 2.17, so binaries are compatible for \[among others] Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 8.
>
> The RHEL folks put in a ton of work to make the devtoolsets work on their older base systems (libc mainly), which involves shipping a delta library that contains the new stuff that can be statically linked in where it's used. We use this method for building Node binary releases.

Preconfigures `prebuildify` to [tag](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify#options) prebuilds with the libc flavor, to set them apart from musl prebuilds, e.g. `linux-x64/node.glibc.node`.

### [`alpine`](https://github.com/orgs/prebuild/packages/container/package/alpine)

Compile in Alpine, which uses musl instead of glibc and therefore can't run regular linux prebuilds. Worse, it sometimes does successfully _load_ such a  prebuild during `npm install` - which prevents a compilation fallback from kicking in - and then segfaults at runtime. You can fix this situation in two ways: by shipping an `alpine` prebuild and/or by shipping a `centos7-devtoolset7` prebuild, because the latter will be skipped in Alpine thanks to the `glibc` tag.

Preconfigures `prebuildify` to [tag](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify#options) prebuilds with the libc flavor, to set them apart from glibc prebuilds, e.g. `linux-x64/node.musl.node`.

### [`linux-armv6`](https://github.com/orgs/prebuild/packages/container/package/linux-armv6)

Cross-compile for Linux ARM. This image thinly wraps a [`dockcross`](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross) image. Preconfigures `prebuildify` to [tag](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuildify#options) prebuilds with the armv version (6).

### [`linux-armv7`](https://github.com/orgs/prebuild/packages/container/package/linux-armv7)

### [`linux-armv7-musl`](https://github.com/orgs/prebuild/packages/container/package/linux-armv7-musl)

## Development

### Releasing

Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) according to [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog), for which you might like [`hallmark`](https://github.com/vweevers/hallmark) to pull commit messages into the changelog:

```
hallmark bump minor
```

Tweak `CHANGELOG.md` as needed until `hallmark lint` is happy. Then commit, tag and push. For example:

```
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "2.1.0"
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m v2.1.0
git push --follow-tags
```

The git tag triggers [CI/CD](https://github.com/prebuild/docker-images/actions) to publish new images to [GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/prebuild/packages?ecosystem=container). A changelog entry is required.
